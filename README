This is a MS. degree thesis project regarding an object reconstruction by means of an optical 
metrology technique which consists on a laser line projection over the object´s surface and 
scanning by the acquisition of several images of the line projection over the surface at 
different locations depending on the desired resolution on the reconstruction. The project
takes advantage of several open source libraries such as CImg, OpenCv, libusb among others.
It includes a GUI on QT and works with three threads that perform different tasks on the
application.

The project is still at the development stage and uses a lot of image processing with CImg and
is supported by other tools such as a PIC(which is programmed in C) that communicates with the 
PC via USB and the PIC also controls a stepper motor which gives the scanning resolution. The
scanning result (primitives and vertices) are saved in an object file format which can be
imported by other software to manipulate the mesh.
