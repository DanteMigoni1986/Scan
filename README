This is a MS. degree thesis project regarding an object reconstruction by means of an optical 
metrology technique which consists on a laser line projection over the object´s surface and 
scanning by the acquisition of several images of the line projection over the surface at 
different locations depending on the desired resolution on the reconstruction. The project
takes advantage of several open source libraries such as CImg, OpenCv, libusb among others.
It includes a GUI on QT and works with three threads that perform different tasks on the
application.
