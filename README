This is a MS. degree thesis project regarding an object reconstruction by means 
of an optical metrology technique which consists on a laser line projection over 
the object´s surface and scanning by the acquisition of several images of the line 
projection over the surface at different locations depending on the desired 
resolution on the reconstruction. The project takes advantage of several open source 
libraries such as CImg, OpenCv, libusb among others.It includes a GUI on QT and works 
with three threads that perform different tasks on the application.

The project is still at the development stage and uses a lot of image processing with 
CImg and is supported by other tools such as a PIC(which is programmed in C) that 
communicates with the PC via USB and the PIC also controls a stepper motor which gives 
the scanning resolution. The scanning result (primitives and vertices) are saved in an 
object file format which can be imported by other software to manipulate the mesh.

The mesh is smoothed by means of using a bezier 2d algorithm or by using a Low pass 
filter(butterworth) mask applied to the mesh . An example of the resulting scan from 
one object´s face can be seen at the "plantilla_bez_fourier.stl" which can be opened 
(for example) in meshlab.
